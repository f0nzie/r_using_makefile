This is a simple notebook to experiment with `Makefile`.

We start by creating a `Makefile` that will only render this notebook.

The `Makefilew looks like this:

```
# we start by processing only one file
simple.html : simple.Rmd
	Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("simple.Rmd")'
```


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

The plot will generated inside the `html` file, meaning it will be self-contained.
